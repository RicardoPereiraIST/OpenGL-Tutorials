# OpenGL Tutorials

This is my attempt at following Joey de Vries OpenGL tutorials (https://learnopengl.com/).

There are multiple dependencies:
>* [Assimp](http://assimp.org/)
>* [Boost](http://www.boost.org/)
>* [Freetype](https://www.freetype.org/)
>* [GLAD](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad)
>* [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/)
>* [GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net)
>* [Stbi](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h)
>* [Vld](https://vld.codeplex.com/)

All the resources are either from Google or linked in Joey's tutorial.


### Problems:

> Model with reflection maps (cubemap tutorial/Original.cpp) isn't working properly.
>
> Applying gamma correction within a framebuffer (Blinn-Phong.cpp) is causing some artifacts.
>
> I'm not entirely sure the shadows in FinalShadows.cpp are correct.

### Incoming:

> Finish all tutorials (2D Game).
>
> Understand and correct problems.
>
> Implement other lights in parallax (Normal_parallax_mapping.cpp).
>
> Implement other lights and (sphere and cone) optimization in Deffered_Shading.cpp.
>
> Create a scene, using multiple techniques.
>
> Maybe find a way to add the "include" keyword within shaders.
