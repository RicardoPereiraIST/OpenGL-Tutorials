### OpenGL Tutorials

This is my attempt at following Joey de Vries OpenGL tutorials (https://learnopengl.com/).

There are multiple dependencies:
>* Assimp
>* Boost
>* Freetype
>* GLAD
>* GLFW
>* GLM
>* Stbi
>* Vld

All the resources are either from Google or linked in Joey's tutorial.


##### Problems:

> Model with reflection maps (cubemap tutorial/Original.cpp) isn't working properly.
>
> Applying gamma correction within a framebuffer (Blinn-Phong.cpp) is causing some artifacts.
>
> I'm not entirely sure the shadows in FinalShadows.cpp are correct.
>
> PBR textures aren't being properly applied to a model (PBR_with_Model.cpp).

##### Incoming:

> Finish all tutorials (2D Game).
>
> Implement other lights in parallax (Normal_parallax_mapping.cpp).
>
> Implement other lights and (sphere and cone) optimization in Deffered_Shading.cpp.
>
> Create a scene, using multiple techniques.
>
> Maybe find a way to add the "include" keyword within shaders.
