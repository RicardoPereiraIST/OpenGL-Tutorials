# Breakout 

This is the implementation of the game Breakout (https://learnopengl.com/#!In-Practice/2D-Game/Breakout).

### Levels

There are currently four levels, but it is quite easy to create more.

### Powerups

There are 6 powerups (4 positive and 2 negative):

>* Chaos - screen moves in circles and is displayed with an edge detection shader.
>* Confuse - screen is reversed.
>* Increase - paddle becomes larger during that life.
>* Passthrough - ball passes through every non solid block, destroying them.
>* Speed - ball gets faster during that life.
>* Sticky - ball gets stuck on paddle until launched again.



### Controls



>* Press "space" to launch ball.
>* Press "a" to move left.
>* Press "d" to move right.
